"<p>As an alternative you can also send us an email to <a href=\"mailto:register@freifunk-uelzen.de\">register@freifunk-uelzen.de</a>. "

"<p>For both types of registrations we need the node name, the public key, name, forename, contact (email or phone) and the location of the node (i.e. street name or -near XYZ-). "
"This data is only needed for the registration. It will not be shared with 3rd parties. </p>"

"<p>To get back to this configuration interface, press the reset button for "
